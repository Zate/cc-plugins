## [2.2.1] - 2025-12-26

### Changed - Command Length Reduction (Progressive Disclosure)

**Continue Command Refactoring**
- Reduced `/devloop:continue` from 1,526 lines to 425 lines (72.0% reduction, 1,100 lines saved)
- Applied progressive disclosure pattern to reference existing skills instead of duplicating content
- Refactored sections:
  - **Context Management** (Step 5c): 293 lines → Reference to `Skill: workflow-loop`
  - **Post-Agent Checkpoint** (Step 5a): 230 lines → Reference to `Skill: task-checkpoint`
  - **Loop Completion Detection** (Step 5b): 226 lines → Reference to `Skill: plan-management`
  - **Agent Execution Templates**: Consolidated to single parameterized pattern
  - **Classification Keywords**: Merged into agent routing table
- Enhanced maintainability:
  - Single source of truth for checkpoint patterns in `task-checkpoint` skill
  - Single source of truth for context management in `workflow-loop` skill
  - Single source of truth for plan completion logic in `plan-management` skill
- All essential workflow steps preserved with skill references for detailed content
- Tested scenarios: resume from plan, fresh start, completion detection, error recovery, parallel tasks
- Backup created: `continue-v1-backup.md` (1,526 lines → 45KB)

**Benefits**
- **Reduced token usage**: 72% smaller command = faster loading, less context bloat
- **Better maintainability**: Skills can be updated independently without touching continue.md
- **Improved readability**: Command shows workflow structure, skills provide implementation details
- **Consistent patterns**: Checkpoint/context/completion logic centralized in skills
- **No functionality loss**: All features preserved, just reorganized

**Files Modified**
- `plugins/devloop/commands/continue.md` (1,526 → 425 lines)
- Created backup: `plugins/devloop/commands/continue-v1-backup.md`
- Analysis: `.devloop/continue-refactor-map.md` (473 lines, working document)

**Architecture**
- Progressive disclosure: Command orchestrates, skills provide detailed patterns
- Skill references: 11 total references to 3 core skills (workflow-loop, task-checkpoint, plan-management)
- Agent routing table: 11 agent types with classification keywords
- Pattern templates: Single parameterized template replaces 11 mode-specific examples

**Testing**
- All workflow steps verified intact (8 main steps)
- Skill references properly formatted (backtick syntax)
- Agent routing table complete (11 agent types mapped)
- Essential patterns present (AskUserQuestion, Task, subagent_type, CRITICAL markers)
- Test plan documented in `.devloop/test-plan.md`

## [2.2.0] - 2025-12-24

### Added - Hook-Based Fresh Start Loop Workflow (FEAT-005)

**Stop Hook with Plan-Aware Routing (Phase 1)**
- Implemented comprehensive Stop hook in `hooks.json` (lines 113-177, +64 lines)
  - Detects `.devloop/plan.md` and evaluates plan state (pending/complete/no plan)
  - Returns structured JSON with routing options: "Continue next task", "Fresh start", "Stop"
  - Detects uncommitted changes and suggests auto-commit workflow (lint → test → commit)
  - Handles edge cases: missing plan, corrupted plan, complete plan
  - Congratulatory message when all tasks complete, suggests `/devloop:ship`
- Documented 9 comprehensive hook test scenarios in `testing.md` (lines 663-1230, +568 lines)
  - Hook Tests 1-4, 7: Stop hook behaviors (pending tasks, no plan, complete plan, uncommitted changes, invalid plan)
  - Hook Tests 5-6, 8: Session start auto-resume, stale state detection, missing plan validation
  - Hook Test 9: End-to-end fresh start workflow with 5-step execution timeline
  - Updated Table of Contents with "Hook Testing" section

**Fresh Start Auto-Resume (Phase 2)**
- Extended `session-start.sh` for automatic resume (lines 498-775, +163 lines net)
  - Detects `.devloop/next-action.json` on session start
  - Validates state with `validate_fresh_start_state()` function (lines 498-557)
    - Timestamp age check (warns if >7 days old, skips auto-resume)
    - Plan existence validation (`.devloop/plan.md` must exist)
    - Escape hatch for invalid state (skips auto-resume, displays warning)
  - Auto-invokes `/devloop:continue` via CRITICAL instruction (no user prompt)
  - Displays "🔄 Fresh start detected - auto-resuming work..." message to user
  - Continue command (Step 1a) reads, validates, and deletes state file (single-use)

**Benefits**
- **Seamless development loop**: Stop → routing options → fresh start → auto-resume
- **No manual steps**: Fully automatic resume from fresh start state
- **Safety validation**: Stale state detection (>7 days), plan existence, graceful error handling
- **Enforces best practices**: Auto-commit suggestions when uncommitted changes detected
- **Clear user experience**: Consistent routing prompts, automatic transitions, no confusion
- **Fresh context enabled**: Supports context clearing with automatic resume on next session

**Architecture**
- Hook-based design (non-invasive, leverages existing infrastructure)
- Stop hook: Plan evaluation and routing (hooks.json)
- Fresh command: State persistence (`/devloop:fresh` from Phase 8)
- Session start hook: Auto-resume detection and validation (session-start.sh)
- Continue command: State file reading and cleanup (continue.md Step 1a)

**Files Modified**
- `plugins/devloop/hooks/hooks.json` (lines 113-177, +64 lines)
- `plugins/devloop/hooks/session-start.sh` (lines 498-775, +163 lines net)
- `plugins/devloop/docs/testing.md` (lines 663-1230, +568 lines)
- `.devloop/plan.md` (Tasks 1.2, 1.3, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 3.1, 3.2 marked complete)
- `.devloop/issues/FEAT-005.md` (status: done, Resolution section added)

**Commits**
- `2b8dd1d`: feat(devloop): implement Stop hook with plan-aware routing (FEAT-005 Task 1.2)
- `7773d73`: docs(devloop): document hook test scenarios (FEAT-005 Task 1.3)
- `a1f355b`: feat(devloop): add auto-resume on fresh start detection (FEAT-005 Task 2.1)
- `09c0092`: feat(devloop): add safety validation for fresh start auto-resume (FEAT-005 Task 2.2)

  - Clear boundaries of responsibilities

**Skill Integration Improvements**
- Added mode-specific skill workflows with invocation order

- Added multi-mode task patterns with 3 complete examples
  - Pattern: "Add [Feature] to [Component]" → Explorer → Architect → (Checkpoint) → Return architecture
  - Pattern: "Refactor and Commit" → Refactorer → Git
  - Pattern: "Trace [Feature] and Fix Issues" → Explorer → Refactorer → (Checkpoint) → Return findings
- Added cross-mode transition rules (when to switch modes, checkpoints when switching)

### Changed

- Updated README.md with workflow loop and fresh start sections
- Updated docs/agents.md with engineer agent improvements from Phase 6
- Updated CHANGELOG.md with comprehensive v2.1.0 entry

### Technical Details

**Line Counts**
- `/devloop:continue`: +584 lines (checkpoint, loop completion, context management)
- `/devloop:fresh`: 348 new lines
- `workflow-loop` skill: 668 new lines
- `ask-user-question-standards.md`: 1,008 new lines
- `task-checkpoint` skill: +224 lines (285→509)
- `engineer.md`: Enhanced with 6 new skills, mode handling, output standards, delegation
- Total additions: ~3,000+ lines of workflow infrastructure

**Integration Points**
- Workflow loop integrates with: continue.md, spike.md, fresh.md, summary.md, ship.md
- Fresh start integrates with: session-start.sh, continue.md, workflow-loop skill
- Task checkpoint integrates with: workflow-loop skill, continue.md checkpoints
- AskUserQuestion standards used in: continue.md (11), review.md (2), ship.md (8), spike.md (1)

**Enforcement Modes**
- Advisory mode (default): Warns when plan/worklog out of sync, allows override
- Strict mode: Blocks commits until plan updated, enforces worklog reconciliation
- Configure in `.devloop/local.md` with `enforcement: advisory|strict`

### Migration Notes

**From v2.0.x**
- No breaking changes
- Fresh start feature is opt-in (use `/devloop:fresh` when needed)
- Workflow loop checkpoints are now mandatory in `/devloop:continue`
- SubagentStop hook removed (was unreliable)
- Plan archival system from v2.0.3 works seamlessly with fresh start

**Recommended Workflow**
1. Use `/devloop:continue` for multi-task work (checkpoints now mandatory)
2. When context feels heavy (5+ tasks, 10+ agents, 2+ hours):
   - Select "Fresh start" option at checkpoint, OR
   - Run `/devloop:fresh` manually
3. Run `/clear` to reset conversation
4. Start new session (SessionStart detects saved state)
5. Run `/devloop:continue` to resume with fresh context
