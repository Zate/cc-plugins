# BUG-002: Spike command doesn't always display full summary before asking next steps

## Description

The `/devloop:spike` command sometimes asks the user what to do next without first displaying a comprehensive summary of the spike findings. Users are asked to make decisions (proceed, defer, abandon, etc.) without seeing a clear recap of what was learned.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Run `/devloop:spike` on a topic
2. Complete the research and evaluation phases
3. Observe that the command may jump to asking "how would you like to proceed?" without showing a structured summary of findings

## Expected Behavior

Before presenting the "what next?" question, the spike command should:
1. Display a formatted summary of all findings
2. Show the recommended approach clearly
3. Present complexity estimate and risks
4. Recap key discoveries
5. THEN ask the user for next steps

## Actual Behavior

The command sometimes skips or truncates the findings summary, going directly to the decision prompt. This leaves users without context for their decision.

## Proposed Fix

In Phase 5 (Report) of `spike.md`, ensure the command:
1. Always writes the full spike report to `.devloop/spikes/{topic}.md`
2. Displays a concise but complete summary in the conversation BEFORE asking for next steps
3. The summary should include at minimum:
   - Answer to the primary question
   - Recommended approach
   - Complexity/risk assessment
   - Top 2-3 key findings

## Notes

Related to BUG-001 (spike creating code). Both issues are about the spike command deviating from its research-only purpose.
