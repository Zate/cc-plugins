# Devloop Plan: Plugin Optimization - Token Efficiency & Progressive Disclosure

**Created**: 2025-12-26
**Updated**: 2025-12-27T14:30:00Z
**Status**: Complete
**Current Phase**: Done
**Estimate**: L (13-19 hours across 5 phases)

## Overview

Optimize devloop plugin for token efficiency and better progressive disclosure based on official Claude Code best practices. Builds on completed "Plugin Best Practices Audit Fixes" plan.

**Focus Areas**:
1. Progressive disclosure for language skills (go, python, java, react)
2. Create core utility scripts (validate-plan, update-worklog, format-commit)
3. Standardize skill frontmatter (whenToUse / whenNotToUse YAML)
4. Extract engineer agent modes to references
5. Additional optimizations (command templates, hook scripts)

**Source**: Spike investigation "Plugin Optimization: Built-in Tools & Token Efficiency"
- Spike report: `.devloop/spikes/plugin-optimization.md`
- Official docs analyzed: Claude Code skills, Agent Skills overview, Best practices

## Architecture Choice

**Phased Progressive Disclosure Strategy**

Breaking optimizations into 5 phases by priority and dependencies:
- Phase 1: Language skills (highest ROI, immediate benefit)
- Phase 2: Core scripts (DRY principle, reusability)
- Phase 3: Skill frontmatter (better invocation)
- Phase 4: Engineer agent (second highest token impact)
- Phase 5: Additional optimizations (completeness)

**Why this approach:**
- Addresses highest-frequency skills first (language patterns trigger often)
- Builds on recent progressive disclosure success (workflow-loop, issue-tracking, plan-management)
- Low-risk refactorings with measurable token savings
- Each phase can be validated independently
- Parallelism opportunities within phases

**Expected Impact**:
- ~2,000+ lines of frequently-loaded content moved to on-demand references
- 40-50% token reduction in language skills (4 skills)
- 50% token reduction in engineer agent (most-used agent)
- Improved maintainability via utility scripts

2. ✅ Core utility scripts created (validate-plan.sh, update-worklog.sh, format-commit.sh)
3. ✅ All 29 skills have standardized whenToUse / whenNotToUse YAML frontmatter
4. ✅ Engineer agent reduced by 50% (1,033 → ~500 lines)
5. ✅ At least 3 additional skills optimized (version-management, atomic-commits, file-locations)
6. ✅ Command templates extracted (onboard.md, ship.md, bootstrap.md <300 lines each)
7. ✅ Hook scripts split for maintainability (session-start.sh <450 lines)
8. ✅ Token efficiency measurably improved (before/after metrics documented)
9. ✅ At least 7 utility scripts created (validate-plan, update-worklog, format-commit, archive-phase, suggest-skills, ship-validation, generate-claudemd)
10. ✅ All changes tested and validated (no regressions, skills trigger correctly)

## Notes

- **Testing is critical** after each phase - verify skills trigger, references load correctly
- **Phase 1 has highest ROI** - language skills trigger frequently on file edits
- **Phases can be done independently** - skip or reorder if needed
- **Parallelism markers** indicate tasks that can run simultaneously within a phase
- **Token impact measurements** should be documented in Progress Log after Phase 1, 4
- Consider using `/devloop:continue` to work through phases systematically
- Reference spike report for detailed rationale: `.devloop/spikes/plugin-optimization.md`
