# BUG-004: Security reports should use timestamped filenames to preserve history

## Description

When running multiple security audits, the report file should not overwrite previous reports. Instead, reports should use timestamped filenames and there should be a way to see older reports.

## Expected Behavior

- Each audit creates a new file: `.claude/security-audit-2025-12-16T12-15-00.md`
- Or use sequential numbering with dates
- Optionally maintain a `security-audit-latest.md` symlink or copy
- Show list of previous reports when starting new audit

## Actual Behavior

Reports may overwrite each other if using a fixed filename.

## Context

- Discovered during: security plugin usage
- Severity: data loss potential (losing previous audit results)
- Blocking: no

## Suggested Fix

1. Use ISO timestamp in filename: `security-audit-YYYY-MM-DDTHH-MM-SS.md`
2. Optionally create/update `security-audit-latest.md` as a reference
3. In the orchestrator, offer to view previous reports before starting new audit
4. Add a command or option to list all previous audit reports
