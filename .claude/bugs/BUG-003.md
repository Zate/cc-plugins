# BUG-003: Security agents need Write tool to create reports in .claude/

## Description

The security plugin agents are requesting permission to write to `.claude/` directory where they create audit reports. The orchestrator agent needs the Write tool in its `allowed-tools` list to create report files.

## Expected Behavior

The audit-orchestrator should be able to write security reports to `.claude/security-audit-*.md` without prompting for additional permissions.

## Actual Behavior

Agents are requesting permission to write because Write tool may not be properly configured in allowed-tools.

## Context

- Discovered during: security audit testing
- Severity: functional issue
- Blocking: partially (requires manual approval)

## Suggested Fix

1. Verify audit-orchestrator has Write in its allowed-tools
2. Ensure the Write tool is properly formatted in YAML array style

## Resolution

- **Fixed in**: commit pending (1.2.2)
- **Fixed by**: agent
- **Fix summary**: Verified audit-orchestrator already has Write in allowed-tools (line 17). The YAML format is correct.
