# BUG-005: Security reports should be stored in .claude/security/ directory

## Description

Security plugin findings and reports should be stored in `.claude/security/` subdirectory to keep all security-related items organized together, rather than cluttering the root `.claude/` directory.

## Expected Behavior

- Audit reports go to `.claude/security/audit-YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- Spike reports go to `.claude/security/spike-report.md`
- Any other security artifacts stay within `.claude/security/`

## Actual Behavior

Security reports are written to `.claude/security-audit-*.md` in the root `.claude/` directory.

## Context

- Discovered during: security plugin organization review
- Severity: organizational/UX
- Blocking: no

## Suggested Fix

1. Update audit-orchestrator to write reports to `.claude/security/`
2. Create directory if it doesn't exist
3. Update README documentation to reflect new path
4. Consider structure:
   ```
   .claude/security/
   ├── audits/
   │   ├── audit-2025-12-16.md
   │   └── audit-2025-12-15.md
   ├── spike-report.md
   └── index.md (optional - list of all audits)
   ```
