# BUG-001: Spike command should overwrite existing spike report

## Description

The spike command/skill currently appends to existing spike reports instead of overwriting them. A new spike should create a fresh report because it represents a new set of ideas/problems. The previous spike was either acted upon or not, but it's no longer relevant to the current investigation.

## Expected Behavior

When running `/devloop:spike`, if a spike report already exists (`.claude/*-spike-report.md`), it should be overwritten with the new spike's findings.

## Actual Behavior

Currently the spike report is appended to, resulting in multiple spike reports concatenated in one file.

## Context

- Discovered during: security plugin spike investigation
- Severity: cosmetic/workflow
- Blocking: no

## Suggested Fix

In the spike command/skill, when writing the spike report:
1. Use the Write tool directly instead of Edit
2. Or explicitly overwrite the file rather than appending
3. Consider using a timestamped filename (e.g., `spike-report-2025-12-16.md`) to preserve history while keeping current spike clean

## Resolution

Fixed by adding explicit instructions in Phase 5 of `spike.md`:
- Added IMPORTANT note: "A new spike = a new report"
- Specifies to use Write tool (not Edit) to overwrite existing reports
- Clarifies that previous spikes are no longer relevant to current investigation
