# BUG-002: Security audit should offer to log findings as bugs via /devloop:bug

## Description

When the security plugin completes an audit and presents findings to the user, one of the AskUserQuestion response options should be to log the findings as bugs using `/devloop:bug` (if the devloop plugin is installed).

This creates better integration between the security and devloop plugins, allowing security findings to flow into the bug tracking workflow.

## Expected Behavior

After security audit completes and shows findings:
```
Use AskUserQuestion:
- question: "How would you like to proceed?"
- header: "Next Steps"
- options:
  - View full report
  - Fix critical issues
  - Log as bugs (Create bug reports for findings via /devloop:bug)
  - Export findings
  - Run another audit
```

## Actual Behavior

Currently the "Log as bugs" option is not offered.

## Context

- Discovered during: security plugin development
- Severity: missing feature
- Blocking: no

## Suggested Fix

1. In `audit-orchestrator.md` Phase 6 (Reporting), add a "Log as bugs" option
2. Check if devloop plugin is available before showing the option
3. For each finding, create a bug with:
   - Title: "[Security] {finding title}"
   - Priority: mapped from severity (Critical→high, High→high, Medium→medium, Low→low)
   - Tags: [security, {category}]
   - Related files: from finding location
